# Development Workflow (How-to)

This guide covers the most common maintenance tasks.

## Use the pinned Python

The generated `.python-version` records the exact Python interpreter that ran
Copier. `uv` uses this file automatically, and template updates preserve it.

## Run local QA before pushing

```bash
make qa
make test
```

CI skips Python linting and tests for Markdown-only changes. Workflow linting runs only when files under `.github/workflows/` change.

If `prek` is not installed, install it once with:

```bash
uv tool install prek
```

## Update dependencies safely

This template uses `uv` groups and cooldown windows.
After dependency changes:

```bash
uv sync
make qa
make test
```

## Publish a release

```bash
make bump
make release
```

Release workflows publish package artifacts and canonical docs.

### Verify release attestations

Each wheel and source distribution has a PEP 740 publish attestation signed
through Sigstore and uploaded to PyPI with the package.

Verify a published artifact by passing its PyPI file URL:

```bash
uvx pypi-attestations verify pypi \
  --repository https://github.com/mgaitan/textual-tetris \
  https://files.pythonhosted.org/path/to/distribution.whl
```

## Preview documentation in pull requests

When docs files change in a PR, CI deploys a preview to:

```text
https://mgaitan.github.io/textual-tetris/_preview/pr-<PR_NUMBER>/
```

If needed, dispatch docs publishing manually:

```bash
gh workflow run cd.yml --ref main
```

`gh` authentication can use {term}`GH_TOKEN`.
